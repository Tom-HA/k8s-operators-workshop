# Initializing the environment

Once the prerequisite (see the [README.md](../README.MD)) are completed, we'll need to initialize the environment.  
We will use _Helmfile_ to install Argo CD which will enable us to complete this workshop by following the GitOps methodology, then, using Argo CD, we'll provision a PostgreSQL database and a PostgreSQL operator.  

To initialize the environment, follow the [README.md in the init-env folder](../init-env/README.md).

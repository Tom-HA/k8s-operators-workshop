Before starting with the workshop, it is recommended to review the documentation in the [overview section](../slides) to better understand the topics we are going to discuss and implement.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the workshop, you'll need to have a Kubernetes cluster available.  
You can run a local cluster using [K3s with K3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/#installation), [Kubernetes with Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation), or any other method you prefer.

### Utilities

Make sure you have the following utilities installed:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile#installation)
* [helm-diff plugin](https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff)
